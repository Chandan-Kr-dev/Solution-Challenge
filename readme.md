📌 AI Model Guidance for Deforestation Detection
🧠 Choosing the Right AI Model
For detecting deforestation and biodiversity loss from satellite images, we need an AI model that can: ✅ Segment forested vs. deforested areas
✅ Analyze historical vs. current images to detect changes
✅ Classify risk levels of deforestation

Here are two best model approaches:

1️⃣ U-Net (Best for Image Segmentation)

Used for land cover classification (i.e., forest vs. non-forest).
Works well with high-resolution satellite images.
Requires labeled datasets (forest/non-forest pixel segmentation).
2️⃣ DeepLabV3 (Advanced Semantic Segmentation)

Can detect fine-grained changes in terrain.
Pre-trained models available on Google TensorFlow Hub.
Suitable for multi-class segmentation (forest, farmland, water, urban areas).
📌 Dataset Selection for Training
You need high-quality satellite images to train the model. Here are the best datasets:

1️⃣ Global Forest Change Dataset (University of Maryland) → Deforestation maps (2000–present)
🔗 https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change

2️⃣ Sentinel-2 Satellite Images (Copernicus Program) → Free high-resolution satellite data
🔗 https://scihub.copernicus.eu/

3️⃣ Google Earth Engine Public Datasets → Pre-processed land cover datasets
🔗 https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/

📌 Model Training & Optimization
1️⃣ Preprocess the Satellite Images

Convert to grayscale or RGB as needed.
Normalize pixel values for better AI training.
Resize images to a standard resolution (e.g., 512x512).
2️⃣ Train the Model

Use TensorFlow/PyTorch.
Loss function: Dice Loss / Cross-Entropy Loss for segmentation.
Optimizer: Adam with learning rate tuning.
3️⃣ Deploy the AI Model

Convert to TensorFlow.js (for running AI in the browser).
Use Google Cloud AI Platform for scalable AI inference.
Deploy as a REST API (FastAPI/PyTorch Serving) for real-time predictions.
🚀 Next Steps
1️⃣ Set Up Google Earth Engine API for satellite image fetching.
2️⃣ Train U-Net or DeepLabV3 with Sentinel-2 data for deforestation detection.
3️⃣ Build Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL + Firebase) to store and process alerts.
4️⃣ Develop Frontend (Next.js + Google Maps API) for visualization.
5️⃣ Deploy AI Model on Google Cloud for real-time analysis.
